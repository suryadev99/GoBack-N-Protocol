# GoBack-N-Protocol
In this  project , you will emulate the operation of a link layer and network layer protocol in a small computer network. You will start several nodes so that they can send packets to each other as if there are links between them. Running as an independent node, your program should implement a simple version of GoBack-N Protocol Link Layer.
